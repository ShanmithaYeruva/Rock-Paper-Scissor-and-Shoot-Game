This is my first python project.
Started 04/01/2025.
This project explores the basic skills to start coding.
I am creating a game of simple rock, paper, scissor and shoot.
This uses tkinter module, random module and pygame.
I define functions, create loops, store variables, add conditionals, add variables continuously to a list and many more exciting things.
